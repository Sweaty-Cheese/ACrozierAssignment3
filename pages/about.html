        <h2>About Reflexology by Sharon</h2>
        <blockquote>
            I'm Sharon, <br>
            <br>
            I have lived in the KW area most of my life. I worked in aesthetics for 36 years. In 2015 I started noticing that<br>
            my client's needs were changing they weren't as concerned about how they looked as much as how they felt. <br>
            <br>
            As more people became stressed, anxious and had more complaints about the pain I decided to look into something that<br>
            would be a nice compliment to my existing business. Reflexology was the perfect fit. <br>
            <br>
            Once my feet were on this path there was no turning back. I couldn't get enough. I read everything I could get my hands on.<br> 
            I certified with the Healing Arts Learning Organization and I am registered<br> with the RRCO (Reflexology Registration Council of Ontario) <br>

            I am now practicing reflexology on a full-time basis.
