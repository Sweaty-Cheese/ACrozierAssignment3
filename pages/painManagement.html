            Mauricio (Moshe) Kruchik is a world-renowned reflexologist and instructor who has travelled the globe to teach his methods.<br>
            He is the creator of the Kruchik Method of Reflexology and he believes that reflexology is surprisingly, wise and simple;<br>
            and as practitioners we are able to provide quick solutions to complex problems from the very first session giving a glimmer<br>
            of hope to clients who have tried everything but not always achieving long lasting results.<br>
            <br>
            Sessions may include Reflexology in Motion and ice packs on the corresponding reflexes. It can bring more flexibility, reduce<br>
            pain and give the client more freedom of movement.<br>
            <br>
            There are 42 different techniques that make up the Kruchik Method that can be used in combination to address many conditions such as:<br>

        <h2>Will Reflexology Help Me?</h2>

        <blockquote>
            Although reflexology is not used to diagnose or cure disease, Reflexology looks at the person as a whole<br>
            and is concerned with the causes of the problem rather than just the symptoms. Many people find it<br>
            helps to relax and release tension in their mind and body giving them a sense of well-being.
